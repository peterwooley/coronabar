A simple app that sits in your menu bar, allowing you to see the total number of [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) cases for the World or select country updated every 15 minutes.

This is a fork of the great work done by [duarteocarmo](https://github.com/duarteocarmo/coronabar).

## Why? 

In an attempt to keep myself from opening all of the COVID-19 dashboards every time I thought of it (every 5 to 15 minutes), I figured having a dedicated count in my menu bar would let me peek at how the world is falling apart but then carry on with my day. After two weeks of using this app, I find myself opening the dashboards less.
